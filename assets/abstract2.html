        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>
        <strong>Objective: </strong>Sperm cryopreservation is an effective technology of artificial insemination for commercial breeders. However, the efflux of phospholipids from the sperm membrane impairs its function which leads to reduce the fertility potential of thawed sperm. Membrane Lipid Replacement with lipid nano-micelles could restore cellular membrane and increase sperm cryo-survival. This study investigated the effects nano-micelles made from glycerophospholipid mixtures (GPL) on the cryo-survival of thawed bull sperm.

        <br>
        <strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> Semen samples were collected from six bulls, twice a week, then mixed and were diluted with the Tris-egg yolk extender containing different concentrations of GPL nano-micelles according to the following groups: control (GPL-0), 0.5% (GPL-0.5), 1% (GPL-1), and 1.5% (GPL-1.5)  , then diluted semen was cooled at 5 Â°C during 2 h and stored in liquid nitrogen. The optimum concentration of GPL was determined by evaluation of the quality parameters including motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, apoptotic-like changes, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial activity of thawed sperm.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Results:</strong> Exposure of sperm to GPL-0.5 significantly increased total, progressive motility, average path velocity (VAP), straight linear velocity (VSL), and curvilinear velocity (VCL), compared to the frozen control group (P<0.05). The percentage of viability and membrane integrity were significantly higher in the GPL-0.5 and GPL-1 compared to the other groups (P<0.05). Moreover, the lowest rate of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis was significantly in GPL-0.5 and GPL-1 groups in comparison to the frozen control group. Mitochondrial activity of thawed sperm was not affected by GPL (P >0.05). 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Our results showed that membrane lipid replacement with GPL micelles (0.5 %, and 1%) could substitute damaged lipids in membrane and protect bull sperm against cryoinjury.
