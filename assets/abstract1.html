    <h4>Abstract:</h4>
    <p>
        Lamb meat is one of the protein sources in the human diet, which is highly susceptible to chemical and microbial spoilage due to its high nutritional value. In this research, separate and combined nanocoatings of Lallemantia royleana gum and Alyssum homolocarpum gum containing Zataria multiflora extract were used to increase the shelf life of this precious product. Zataria multiflora extract was extracted by ultrasonic method. The results showed that the amount of total phenol and flavonoid in Zataria multiflora extract is high. Also, the antioxidant properties of the extract by DPPH method and beta-carotene: linoleic acid were similar to TBHO antioxidant. Microbial tests showed that the extract had the ability to inhibit the growth and bactericidal effect on L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, S. enterica and E. coli. In this study, a separate coating and a combination of Lallemantia royleana and Alyssum homolocarpum gums containing Zataria multiflora extract were created on lamb fillet. The results of chemical (pH, p, TVN, TBA) and microbial tests (TC, PTC, S. aureus count, E. coli count) showed that all the treatments were spoiled with time, but compared to the control sample, this process was slower. Based on the results obtained from this research, the coating of nano Lallemantia royleana gum + nano Alyssum homolocarpum gum containing Zataria multiflora extract had the best performance and is recommended as a method of preserving lamb meat in refrigerator conditions
